    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Air pollution is a silent killer. Every year, thousands of New Yorkers are slowly dying from doing the vital act of breathing. While the air we breathe smells and seems fine, it’s often the case that it’s littered with tiny particulate matter (PM) that are only several micrometers in diameter. PM usually consists of various air pollutants that can cause respiratory irritation, inflammation, as well as other adverse health effects. In fact, according to the study Air Pollution and the Health of New Yorkers, the air we breathe is responsible for more than 3000 deaths and an additional 2000 cases of hospitalizations due to respiratory and cardiovascular causes annually. </p>

            <h3>What</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Airometer. This website will allow you to visualize the filth in the air you’re currently breathing. Our map shows the air quality of various neighborhoods in NYC. The circles on the map indicate the intensity of air pollutants in that area. The redder the markers are the higher the concentration of pollutants in the air. And the greener the markers are, the lower the concentration of pollutants in the air.</p>

            <h3>Why</h3>
            <p>We hope that by displaying this information in an easily comprehensible format, a color-coded labeled map, you, the user, can see how close to home the problem is. An interactive map is a lot more effective in showing the user how real the problem is than a plain table.</p>

            <p>As of right now, our data is limited to only past years in NYC. We plan on finding a reliable source of up-to-date data to upload to our interactive map.</p>
